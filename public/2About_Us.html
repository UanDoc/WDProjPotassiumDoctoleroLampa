                I was the one who developed the idea of this website. I lowkey, love how the website turned out (mostly because I made most of the css). I hope, you (kung sino ka man) enjoyed the website. Anyways, aside from my opinions regarding the website I also liked the #teamwork. Working with Rey was fun(ny). PS, my favorite apple variant is the Fuji apple.

                I really liked making this website because I made (some of) the elemetns #graphic design is my passion. I hope you liked the website as much as I do. Aside from that I really enjoyed working with Uan he's funny as hell and he carried.
