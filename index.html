                Reflection about the CS web design project:

            <div class = "text2">
                The Computer Science Web design project allowed us (Uan and Rey) to explore our creativty with each and every web page that we developed as a result of this project. Aside from creativity, we also learned how to use our knowledge in Mathematics to further develop the JavaScript portion of this project. To be honest, this project was sort of difficult for the both of us due to our lack of experience with coding in both Javascript and HTML but we were able to produce a website that we are proud of.
